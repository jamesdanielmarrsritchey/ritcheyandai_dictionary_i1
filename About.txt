Notes:
 - This project was developed in part by using the tool GitHub Copilot Business.
 - Terms are initially defined using artificial intelligence (AI), and are later vetted by a human. Check the status of a term to see where it's at in the development process. Currently all terms are in the draft phase, which means they have not been reviewed for accuracy by a person yet. Be aware that AIs can provide content that isn't correct.
