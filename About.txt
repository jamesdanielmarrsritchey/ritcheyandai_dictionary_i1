Notes:
 - The project was developed in part by using the tool GitHub Copilot Business.
 - Terms are initially defined using artificial intelligence (AI), and are later vetted by a human. Check the status of a term to see where it's at in the development process. Currently all terms are in the draft phase, which means they have not been reviewed for accuracy. Be aware that AIs can provide content that isn't correct.
