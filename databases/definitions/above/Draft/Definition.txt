In a general sense, "above" is a preposition or an adverb that refers to a higher place or position. For example, "The bird is flying above the trees."

In a business context, "above" often refers to a higher level or rank within an organizational hierarchy. For example, "The manager is above the team lead in the organizational structure." It can also refer to performance or targets, as in "Our sales this quarter are above expectations."

In a programming context, "above" can refer to the position of code in a file or script. Code that is "above" is written before other pieces of code. For example, in Python, function definitions need to be placed "above" or before the function calls in the script. 

```python
# Function definition is here, "above" the function call
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

# Function call is here
greet()
```

The term "above" has been in use since Old English, derived from the words "a," meaning "on," and "bufan," meaning "over." Its use in business and programming contexts has evolved naturally with the development of these fields.
