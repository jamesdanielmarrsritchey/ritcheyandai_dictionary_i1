jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Define "Debian" in a general sense of the term, within a business context, and lastly within a programming context. Provide examples, and a brief history of the term.

GitHub Copilot: **General Definition:**
Debian is a free and open-source operating system, which uses the Linux or FreeBSD kernel. It's known for its robustness, reliability, and the large number of software packages available for it. Debian is used as a base for many other distributions, including Ubuntu.

**Business Context:**
In a business context, Debian is often used as a server operating system due to its stability and security features. It's also used in enterprise environments for workstations, owing to its extensive software support. Businesses may choose Debian because of its strong community support, long-term support versions, and no licensing costs, which can reduce the total cost of ownership.

**Programming Context:**
For programmers, Debian provides a rich set of development tools and libraries. Its package management system, APT, makes it easy to install, update, and remove software. It's also a common choice for web servers, database servers, and development environments. For example, a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on Debian is a popular choice for web development.

**Brief History:**
Debian was first announced in 1993 by Ian Murdock, named as a portmanteau of his then-girlfriend (later wife) Debra and his own name, Ian. Debian 1.0 was officially released in 1996. The project is maintained by a community of developers from around the world and guided by the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines.
