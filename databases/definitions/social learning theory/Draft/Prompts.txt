GitHub Copilot: **General Context:** Social Learning Theory, proposed by Albert Bandura, posits that people learn from one another, via observation, imitation, and modeling. It suggests that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context and can occur purely through observation or direct instruction.

**Business Context:** In a business setting, Social Learning Theory can be applied to organizational behavior and human resources practices. For example, new employees learn the norms and expectations of the company not only through formal training but also by observing and imitating more experienced colleagues. 

**Programming Context:** In the context of programming, Social Learning Theory can be seen in practices like pair programming, code reviews, and open-source contribution. Programmers learn new skills and improve their code by observing others' work, receiving feedback, and modeling their code after more experienced developers' work.
