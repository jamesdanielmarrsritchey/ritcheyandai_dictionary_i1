In a general sense, "all" is a term used to refer to the whole quantity or extent of a particular group or thing. It is an inclusive term that leaves nothing out. For example, if you say "all the people in the room", you are referring to every single person present in the room, without exception.

In a business context, "all" can refer to the entirety of a company's assets, resources, or stakeholders. For example, "all our employees" refers to every individual working for the company, from the CEO to the newest hire. "All our assets" would refer to every resource owned by the company, including physical assets like buildings and equipment, as well as intangible assets like intellectual property or brand reputation.

In a programming context, "all" often refers to every element in a collection or every instance of a particular type. For example, in a database query, you might use "SELECT ALL" to retrieve every record from a table. In a loop, "for all elements in array" would mean performing an operation on every item in the array.

The term "all" has been in use since Old English, derived from the Old Norse word "allr", meaning "whole". Its use in business and programming contexts has evolved naturally as these fields have developed, with the term being used to express the concept of totality or completeness in various situations.
