In a general sense, "add" refers to the process of combining two or more things together. For example, you might add ingredients together to make a recipe, or add numbers together in a math problem.

In a business context, "add" often refers to the process of including something extra to enhance a product or service. For example, a company might add a new feature to its software to make it more appealing to customers. 

In a programming context, "add" usually refers to the operation of combining two or more values. This can be numerical addition, but it can also refer to operations like concatenating strings or merging data structures. For example, in Python, you can add two numbers with the `+` operator:

```python
result = 1 + 2  # result is now 3
```

You can also add (concatenate) two strings:

```python
greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"  # greeting is now "Hello, world!"
```

The term "add" has been used in these contexts for many years. In mathematics, the concept of addition dates back to ancient times, and it's one of the fundamental operations in arithmetic. In business, the idea of adding value or features to a product or service is a key part of many strategies. In programming, the concept of addition is fundamental to many operations and algorithms, and it's been part of programming languages since the earliest days of computer science.
