In a general sense, "agree" means to have the same opinion about something, to consent to an idea, or to say "yes" to a proposal. For example, two friends might agree on where to go for dinner.

In a business context, "agree" often refers to the act of consenting to a contract or a deal. For example, two companies might agree on the terms of a partnership.

In a programming context, "agree" can refer to the concept of two or more systems, components, or pieces of software producing the same result or behaving in the same way under given conditions. This is often referred to as "consensus" in distributed systems. For example, in a distributed database, multiple nodes might need to "agree" on the value of a piece of data before it's written.
