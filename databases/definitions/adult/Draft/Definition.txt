In a general sense, an "adult" refers to a person who has reached the age of majority, which varies by country but is typically 18 or 21 years old. This is the age at which a person is legally considered to be fully responsible for their actions. For example, an adult can sign contracts, vote, and be tried as an adult in a court of law.

In a business context, "adult" often refers to a target demographic for certain products or services. These are typically products or services that are not suitable or intended for children or teenagers. For example, an alcohol company may market its products to adults, as it is illegal in many places for minors to purchase alcohol.

In a programming context, "adult" could refer to content or data that is intended for adults only. This could be due to the content being explicit, such as adult-themed video games or websites. For example, a website may have a mechanism to verify a user's age before allowing access to adult content. This could be implemented in code as follows:

```python
def verify_age(age):
    if age >= 18:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

In this Python code, the function `verify_age` checks if the provided age is 18 or older. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the user is an adult. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
