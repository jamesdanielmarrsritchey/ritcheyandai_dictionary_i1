GitHub Copilot: **Behaviorism** in a general sense is a theory of learning based on the idea that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning. It's a school of psychology that focuses on observable behaviors rather than internal thoughts or feelings.

In a **business context**, behaviorism might refer to the study and application of how workers' behaviors can be modified to encourage productivity, efficiency, and job satisfaction. For example, a manager might use positive reinforcement (like bonuses or recognition) to encourage desired behaviors, such as punctuality or high-quality work.

In a **programming context**, behaviorism often refers to the concept of behavior-driven development (BDD). BDD is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. For example, developers might write behavior tests that define how a piece of software should act under certain conditions, then write code to fulfill those conditions.
