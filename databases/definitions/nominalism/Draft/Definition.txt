Nominalism is a philosophical view which denies the existence of universals and abstract objects, but affirms the existence of individuals. 

In a general sense, nominalism suggests that only actual physical particulars are real, and that universals exist only post factum, as names, labels or mental constructs.

In a business context, nominalism might refer to the idea that business concepts and categories (like "market segment" or "brand value") are not inherent, objective realities, but are instead names or labels that we use to group together certain phenomena based on shared characteristics. For example, the category "luxury cars" doesn't have an inherent existence; it's a label we use to group together cars that share certain characteristics like high price, high quality materials, etc.

In a programming context, nominalism could refer to the idea that data types and classes are not inherent properties of the data or objects themselves, but are instead labels that programmers use to categorize data and objects based on their characteristics or the operations that can be performed on them. For example, in a programming language like Java, the "String" data type is not an inherent property of the sequence of characters it represents; it's a label that programmers use to indicate that certain operations (like concatenation or substring extraction) can be performed on this data.

Please note that these are broad interpretations and the term "nominalism" is not commonly used in business or programming contexts.
