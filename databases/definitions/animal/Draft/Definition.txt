1. General Sense: An "animal" is a living organism that feeds on organic matter, typically having specialized sense organs and nervous system and able to respond rapidly to stimuli. Examples include dogs, cats, elephants, and humans.

2. Business Context: In the business world, "animal" is not a standard term. However, it can be used metaphorically to describe certain behaviors or characteristics. For instance, "bull" and "bear" are used to describe market conditions. A "bull" market is when prices are rising or are expected to rise, while a "bear" market is characterized by falling prices and typically shrouded in pessimism.

3. Programming Context: In programming, "Animal" could be a class in an object-oriented programming language. This class might have properties like "name", "age", "species", etc., and methods like "eat", "sleep", etc. For example, in Python:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def eat(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is eating.")

    def sleep(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is sleeping.")
```

In this example, "Animal" is a class, and "name" and "age" are its attributes. "eat" and "sleep" are methods of this class.
