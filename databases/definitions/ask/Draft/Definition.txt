In a general sense, "ask" refers to the act of making a request or seeking information from someone or something. For example, "I asked my friend for directions."

In a business context, "ask" often refers to the price that a seller is willing to accept for a particular item. For example, "The ask price for the house is $300,000." It can also refer to a request or requirement in a business deal or negotiation, such as "The investor's ask was a 20% equity stake in the company."

In a programming context, "ask" usually refers to a function or method that prompts the user for input. For example, in Python, the `input()` function is used to ask the user for input: 

```python
user_input = input('Please enter your name: ')
```

In this case, the program is asking the user to enter their name.
