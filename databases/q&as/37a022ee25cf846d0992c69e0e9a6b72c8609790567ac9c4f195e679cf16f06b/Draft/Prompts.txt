jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Which programming language is the best?

GitHub Copilot: The "best" programming language can vary greatly depending on the specific use case, personal preference, and the environment in which it's being used. Some people might prefer Python for its simplicity and wide use in data science, others might prefer JavaScript for web development, or C++ for system programming. It's important to choose a language that fits the requirements of your project and that you feel comfortable using.
