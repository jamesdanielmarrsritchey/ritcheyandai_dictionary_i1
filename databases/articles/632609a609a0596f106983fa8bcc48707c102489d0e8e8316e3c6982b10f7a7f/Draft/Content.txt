Websites are often supported by advertisements due to several reasons:

1. Covering Operational Costs: Running a website involves various costs such as domain registration, hosting, security, and maintenance. Advertisements provide a steady stream of income to cover these expenses.

2. Monetizing Content: Websites often offer valuable content to their users for free, such as articles, videos, tutorials, and more. By hosting advertisements, these websites can earn revenue from their content without charging users directly.

3. Supporting Free Services: Some websites offer free services, like search engines, email services, social networks, etc. These services are costly to maintain, and advertisements help these companies generate revenue to support these free services.

4. Profit Motive: Beyond just covering costs, advertisements can also generate profit for the website owners. This is especially true for websites with a large number of visitors.

5. Targeted Advertising: Advertisements on websites can be targeted based on user behavior and preferences, making them more effective for advertisers. This makes web advertising attractive for businesses, and thus, profitable for website owners.

6. Sustaining Growth and Development: The revenue from advertisements can be reinvested into the website to improve its services, add new features, and grow its user base.

In summary, advertisements play a crucial role in the internet economy. They provide a source of revenue that helps cover the costs of running the website, such as server costs, maintenance, content creation, and staff salaries. This revenue also allows many websites to offer their content for free to users, as the costs are offset by the income from advertisements.
